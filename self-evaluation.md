# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

**I am about 4/5 confident with the each method. The multiple examples in the lesson really helped.**

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

**We've had decent practice researching topics on our own, so I wouldn't say it was too overwhelming. Thankfully, I didn't endure any unproductive struggle in this exercise, and the only productive struggle I encountered involved confusing array methods for string methods while searching through the documentation.**

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

**I need to practice my vernacular and explaining technical concepts without confusing different terms. I am going to start speaking aloud while I code alone and see if that helps. I won't need to adjust my calendar for that strategy.**

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

**I don't have any questions, but if one comes up, I'll ask my small group.**
